Malamute Games is developing video games the way we think they should be.

Malamute Games is single-handedly run by **Benjamin Mugnier**. It allows
him to market games he wouldn't otherwise, as he's almost undercover.

We strongly believe in open source software and only use OSS tools to develop
and design. Yes, even the operating system.

We're open to any **suggestions** or **business inquiries**, feel free to
contact us.
