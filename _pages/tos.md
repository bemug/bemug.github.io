## We don't store your data, period.

We don't have to, we don't want to.
You don't even have to create an account to use our software.

We physically can’t. We have nowhere to store it. We don’t even have a server database to store it. So even if someone asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show him.
